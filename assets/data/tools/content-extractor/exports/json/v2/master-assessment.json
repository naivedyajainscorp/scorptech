Pilot optimization projects on highest-downtime maintenance activities demonstrate what's possible—'prepared parts kits and detailed work planning reduced compressor PM from 8 hours to 4 hours.' Success stories build organizational belief that downtime is reducible through systematic improvement, creating momentum for broader optimization initiatives measuring and minimizing production impact."

Weekly visibility supports monthly budget management but prevents timely intervention on emerging problems.

The lag creates cascading problems: January overrun isn't visible until February, forcing February spending cuts that create operational disruptions, but February cuts aren't confirmed until March.

Machine learning algorithms optimize reorder points and quantities: instead of fixed \"reorder when stock hits 50 units,\" system dynamically adjusts based on consumption velocity, lead time variability, and demand patterns—perhaps 50 units during high season, 20 during low season. ABC analysis automatically categorizes inventory by value and turnover, focusing management attention on high-impact items. Slow-mover reports identify obsolete stock for liquidation. This intelligence enables dramatic inventory optimization: reduced carrying costs (less capital tied up in excess stock), improved availability (fewer stockouts from optimized reorder points), and waste reduction (early detection of unusual consumption prevents losses from escalating).</p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        \n        <div class=\"s-accordion-item\">\n          <button class=\"s-accordion-trigger\" type=\"button\">\n            <span class=\"s-accordion-trigger-text\">Partially—can see consumption totals but limited trend analysis or anomaly detection</span>\n            <i class=\"fas fa-chevron-down s-accordion-icon\"></i>\n          </button>\n          <div class=\"s-accordion-panel\">\n            <div class=\"s-accordion-body\">\n              <p>Systems provide basic consumption reporting—totals by item, department, or time period—but lack sophisticated analytics.

Requires human interpretation to notice patterns or anomalies buried in data. This provides visibility but not intelligence—can answer \"how much was consumed?\" but not \"is this normal?\" or \"what should we expect next month?\" Reorder points are set manually based on judgment rather than statistical analysis of actual consumption patterns.

Cannot answer: exactly how fast is \"awfully fast\"? Is current consumption 10% above normal or 200%? Is the rarely-requested item truly obsolete or just low-season? Without data, intuition cannot drive systematic action: can't quantify waste to justify investigation, can't optimize reorder points scientifically, can't distinguish normal variation from significant anomalies.
